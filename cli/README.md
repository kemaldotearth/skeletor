## What is this?
This is an attempt to bring designers and developers a faster way to scaffold the frontend of their design system. While there are various great stacks out there, bootstrapping a simple React component library is still _a bit of work_.

This project is an attempt to build a CLI tool that can bundle all your favourite packages by default in one simple command.

Potential uses:
- Bootstrap a simple UI library with all deps and opinionated folder structure.
- Down the line perhaps add support for things like Headless UI or Radix.
- Generate items such as design tokens.
- This could be done by providing hex values as input and Skeletor generating it toward a colour scale.
- Something else?

The project is **currently WIP**. 


## Contributing
For the moment contributions are not open, but open for ideas on what else this simple CLI tool could potentially take care of.
